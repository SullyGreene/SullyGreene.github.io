            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sully Greene</strong>—a passionate 🤖 AI developer and tech enthusiast with nearly three decades of experience. My journey in technology began at the age of three with my first 🖥️ computer running <strong>Windows 95</strong>. Since then, I've been deeply connected to computers, programming, and the ever-evolving tech landscape. 💻</p>
            <p>At 12, I ventured into the world of <strong>Linux</strong> 🐧, starting with <strong>Ubuntu</strong> and eventually exploring other distributions. Currently, <strong>Arch Linux</strong> is my daily driver, valued for its customization capabilities, while I still enjoy <strong>Windows 11</strong> on my laptop for its intuitive, console-like interface 🎮. My innate curiosity and drive to solve challenges have been the foundation of my passion for AI and open-source projects. 🚀</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">🌐 Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>🐍 <strong>Python</strong> is my go-to language, and I’m a strong advocate of frameworks like <strong>Streamlit</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> for their seamless integration with data and visual tools 📊. These tools allow me to bring ideas to life with both functionality and aesthetics, making them perfect for my projects in data visualization, prototyping, and AI. 🧠✨</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">💡 Development Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe in keeping things <strong>simple, modular, and extendable</strong> 🛠️. My development philosophy is to write reusable code and provide clear documentation, making it easy for others to understand, use, and expand upon my work. 📄 I openly share my projects and development process on <strong>GitHub</strong> 🐱 and <strong>Hugging Face</strong> 🤗, supporting open-source growth and fostering a collaborative AI community. 🌍🤝</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">🤖 AI, Agents, and Future Visions</h2>
            <p>I've been an enthusiastic supporter of <strong>OpenAI</strong> 🧠 since the early days, joining as a beta tester and one of the first Plus subscribers. 💡 I strongly believe in AI’s potential, especially in <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and agents, which I see as key to the future. 🔑 Recently, I organized my codebase into three core projects, with <strong>TinyAGI</strong> as my flagship package. <strong>TinyAGI</strong> consolidates foundational code across projects, reducing redundancy and setting the stage for increased efficiency as I continue refining my tools. ⚙️💡</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">🎉 Open Source Contributions & Custom Datasets</h2>
            <p>I'm committed to open source and frequently share my work on <strong>Hugging Face</strong> 🤗. Lately, I’ve been focused on creating and customizing my own AI datasets 📚, especially reformatting <strong>Alpaca-style</strong> datasets for unique use cases. Creating my first <strong>PyPI</strong> 🐍 package was a significant milestone, enabling easy sharing and porting of my work across environments. 🌐✨</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">📜 Documentation and Community</h2>
            <p>I document every step of my journey on <strong>GitHub</strong> 🐱—not only to showcase my projects but also to provide a resource for others. My approach centers around accessibility and transparency, guided by the principle of <strong>“just read the manual”</strong> 📖. I believe that with clear documentation, any application becomes more adaptable, accessible, and ready for growth. 🌱</p>
