## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Sully Greene**—a passionate 🤖 AI developer and tech enthusiast with nearly three decades of experience. My journey in technology began at the age of three with my first 🖥️ computer running **Windows 95**. Since then, I've been deeply connected to computers, programming, and the ever-evolving tech landscape. 💻

At 12, I ventured into the world of **Linux** 🐧, starting with **Ubuntu** and eventually exploring other distributions. Currently, **Arch Linux** is my daily driver, valued for its customization capabilities, while I still enjoy **Windows 11** on my laptop for its intuitive, console-like interface 🎮. My innate curiosity and drive to solve challenges have been the foundation of my passion for AI and open-source projects. 🚀

## 💪 Skills

- 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization
- 🐍 Python, 💻 JavaScript, 🚀 Streamlit, 🧩 Flask
- 🐧 Linux System Administration

## 🌐 Tech Stack

🐍 **Python** is my go-to language, and I’m a strong advocate of frameworks like **Streamlit** and **Flask** for their seamless integration with data and visual tools 📊. These tools allow me to bring ideas to life with both functionality and aesthetics, making them perfect for my projects in data visualization, prototyping, and AI. 🧠✨

## 💡 Development Philosophy

I believe in keeping things **simple, modular, and extendable** 🛠️. My development philosophy is to write reusable code and provide clear documentation, making it easy for others to understand, use, and expand upon my work. 📄 I openly share my projects and development process on **GitHub** 🐱 and **Hugging Face** 🤗, supporting open-source growth and fostering a collaborative AI community. 🌍🤝

## 🤖 AI, Agents, and Future Visions

I've been an enthusiastic supporter of **OpenAI** 🧠 since the early days, joining as a beta tester and one of the first Plus subscribers. 💡 I strongly believe in AI’s potential, especially in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and agents, which I see as key to the future. 🔑 Recently, I organized my codebase into three core projects, with **TinyAGI** as my flagship package. **TinyAGI** consolidates foundational code across projects, reducing redundancy and setting the stage for increased efficiency as I continue refining my tools. ⚙️💡

## 🎉 Open Source Contributions & Custom Datasets

I'm committed to open source and frequently share my work on **Hugging Face** 🤗. Lately, I’ve been focused on creating and customizing my own AI datasets 📚, especially reformatting **Alpaca-style** datasets for unique use cases. Creating my first **PyPI** 🐍 package was a significant milestone, enabling easy sharing and porting of my work across environments. 🌐✨

## 📜 Documentation and Community

I document every step of my journey on **GitHub** 🐱—not only to showcase my projects but also to provide a resource for others. My approach centers around accessibility and transparency, guided by the principle of **“just read the manual”** 📖. I believe that with clear documentation, any application becomes more adaptable, accessible, and ready for growth. 🌱
